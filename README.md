Personal &amp; Portfolio Site written in HTML, CSS &amp; JS from Scratch.  Stopping here with JS before trying to build a site in React.

## Why this project?

This project allows me to tackle a few goals simultaneously:

**Design More.**  

**Learn CSS Grid and Brush Up on HTML/CSS.**

**Experiment with Managing Content** ***Including my own thoughts.***

Since I was a little boy I've been writing down ideas.  I remember often waking up in the middle of the night in middle school and jotting them down in this little spiral-bound notepad I kept next to my bed.  Scribbling got more sophisticated when my Dad gave me his old Palm Pilot.  Things went digital.

Since then I've tried a number of pencil, pen and keyboard methods to keep my notes and have never really settled on a consistent method.

In high school I got acquainted with Microsoft OneNote, but still mostly took notes by hand.  

In college I used Microsoft OneNote for note taking almost exclusively.  The binder, section, and page organization was perfect and I could insert rich media like pictures and attachments.  I could also draw in freehand or with shapes.  I started journaling in college - not very consistently, but enough to build quite a collection.  By journaling, I mean writing about a wide variety of topics - some about my inner life (what I was thinking and feeling) - but more often about big picture ideas.  How the world works.  Observations about the people and wider society around me.  Opportunities to make it better.  And much of this coalesced into plotting the trajectory of my own life.  

At some point I lost a bunch of notes I had from high school and college.  There was a large "untitled" section that I had intended to eventually sort, and I can't remember exactly what happened, but somehow the file got corrupted.  I think I still have it somewhere and it's a pretty large file, but it always opens blank.  I should take another look at that...

After college I started writing in Evernote.  Onenote seemed so heavy for quick one-off notes, even though it was available across all of my devices.  I started writing quick notes in Evernote that I would plan on copying into Onenote and writing in more depth there.  But they never quite made it to the in-depth writing stage.

After a few years Evernote wasn't quite doing it for me either.  Now I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, then a Note 8.  It was super convenient to write quick notes and tasks there, but they didn't sync to any other devices.  (I eventually found a Windows 10 Samsung Notes App.)  

Then I got deeper into design and simultaneously the Apple ecosystem.  I got an iPad as part of my MBA program then a Macbook Pro when I started designing.  Apple Notes replaced evernote as my 'quick notes' go-to, but I still had unresolved issues with OneNote and writing across two different platforms.  

I started writing on Medium.  But they built a paywall into their platform and as others have noted, we don't control that platform.  I became more interested in open source projects and the philosophy of really owning and managing your own content.

There are a number of note taking applications out there I've played around with, with a varying degree of features.  Google Keep.  Sending yourself an e-mail.  Bookmarks.  

Ultimately here are the goals I'm trying to achieve:
- Lightweight, quick note taking for extemporaneous ideas.
- Future-proof formatting.  
- Full ownership and access.  
- Device and platform agnostic.  Sync (or at least access from) an Android phone, an iPad or Surface Pro 3.  Even better if you can access notes within a browser.  
- Search
- Tagging (not a must have)
- Blog CMS (if possible)

For these ends:
- Start writing down my observations about the world consistently, in long form.
- Have one place, once space to think about ideas, questions and the future.  
- Spend more time publishing content than organizing it.  

I'll probably still use Apple reminders or Microsoft tasks or Google reminders for day to day list creation, but I want to get away from *any* note-taking outside of the model above.
