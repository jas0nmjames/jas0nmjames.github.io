Personal and Portfolio Site written in HTML, CSS and JS from Scratch.  Stopping here with JS before trying to build a site in React.

## about

`#design`, `#systems-thinking` and `#business` for the `#common-good`.

I'm a product design generalist who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way.

*For you fellow MBAs out there*, I'm a skilled user experience (UX) generalist putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders and working with developers line by line in code.

I design and manage projects with cross.team in South Florida, USA.
