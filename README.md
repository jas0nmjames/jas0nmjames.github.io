Personal and Portfolio Site written in HTML, CSS and Markdown with Jekyll.  Starting from scratch (not with a template) to learn for understanding.  On a journey to learn the JAMstack.  Next stop, design in Framer and build in React.

## Project Goals

- [x] **Write in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) as widely as possible.**  This includes when taking personal notes, writing documentation for work, and in this case, creating site content.  For many years I've had notes in all sorts of formats across different devices.  It's been inefficient and a pain to unify.  I'd like to follow [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) principles.  With markdown, I own my content and formatting is (largely) universal.
- [x] Create clean markdown copies of my past writing for archival purposes.  
- [x] **Build and deploy a site on my own** rather than through a CMS like Wordpress.  See above.  
- [x] Experiment with static site generators (**SSGs**).  See [below](#why).
- [ ] Refresh my **Sketch** chops.  I've been working a lot in Figma recently at work.  In another side project concurrent to this one, I'm refreshing my Adobe XD chops.  
- [x] Learn **CSS Grids**.  See inspiration from [Ahmad Nassri](https://ahmadnassri.com/) / [Olivia Ng](https://twitter.com/meowlivia_/status/1116784686640979968)
- [ ] Work on my **UI** chops.
- [ ] Learn the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) a bit better after seeing my dev colleagues working in React and Gatsby.

## Why

I've been working (Fall 2019) as a designer / project manager with React developers to build products with a component driven design system (Figma -> Storybook -> React), theming API, and JSON data.  

As we move into Winter 2019/2020, our team is exploring building SSGs with tools like [React](https://reactjs.org/, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).  

Not only am I interested in design systems, but our small-team, cross-functional project approach at [cross.team](http://cross.team/) means as a designer I'm often thinking about development.  

I'd like to learn to design with React, but I want a stepping stone to truly understand fundamentals like deployment, first.

## Milestones

- 2019-12-08 Initial home page design in sketch completed.  Began building page with CSS grid in `working-folder > home.html`
- 2019-12-01 Deployed to Jekyll
- 2019-11-16 to 2019-11-26 - Copying and cleaning up site content currently hosted elsewhere.  I wanted to do this manually rather than use an export tool so it was clean and I could review the content in detail.  Began writing additional content during this time as well.  
- 2019-11-05 - Gathering content, creating an early site map and thinking about site architecture.
- 2019-11-04 - Initial Commit
