# Tasklist

## Phase One

### Questions/Problems/Why

- Ownership and control of my content.  Don't get stuck in proprietary silos.  See [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/)
- Unify how I write.  I used to use lots of apps across lots of different devices for lots of different purposes.  I'm aiming to use markdown as widely as possible: personal note taking, professional note taking, long-form writing, publishing content to the web, and writing documentation.  Writing all with markdown in either VS Code or Atom.  Also exploring iA Writer.  
- Learn the JAMstack better after exposure to React and Gatsby.  
- Build resume with css grids like https://ahmadnassri.com/ / https://twitter.com/meowlivia_/status/1116784686640979968

### Content

- [x] Convert wordpress site pages to markdown
- [x] Convert medium articles to markdown (maybe easier taking from medium than from wordpress?)
- [ ] Update resume & about me
  - I'm leaning towards: product management, ux generalist (note toolkit), design systems, and interaction design (which in my case really is a sub-set of design systems).  Don't focus on visual design.  
  - [ ] F-pattern: list disciplines (design systems, user research, interaction design) with associated tools (figma, xd, sketch).  
  - [ ] F-pattern part 2: connect f-pattern with projects are broader interests

### Design

- [x] Outline content.  See [content-home.md](content-home.md)
- [ ] Wireframe: mobile-first responsive
- [ ] Branding: Typography, Color, Shape
- [ ] High Fidelity
- [ ] ? Add design to Jekyll theme library. (Contribute to open source!) http://jekyllthemes.org/

### Code

- [x] Investigate SSGs: Gatsby vs Jekyll vs Hugo.  Conclusion: go with Jekyll for now; Gatsby after you learn React.  
- [x] Investigate CMSs.  Forestry.io, etc.  Conclusion: git/Github is fine for now.  
- [x] Copyright?
- [ ] Resume: CSS Grid
- [x] Blog content: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)?
- [ ] Accessibility: implement alt-tags

### Publish

- [x] Create Repository
- [x] Static Site Generator: Jekyll
- [x] Publish to Github Pages
- [ ] Redirect [jasonmjam.es](https://jasonmjam.es/) to Github pages

## Phase Two

### Questions/Problems/Why

- Idea: site opens like firefox read mode: no images = sustainability. Reference https://sustywp.com/ inspired by Sustainable UX slack.
- Learn the JAMstack better after exposure to React and Gatsby.
  - Learn React & Framer
  - Build site with Gatsby?

### content

- [ ] Decide: build own book list or use goodreads
- [ ] Decide: how do I build my own (but shared publically) open source reference
