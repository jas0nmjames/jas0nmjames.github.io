##### Project THOR

Lead product designer. Worked closely with front end and back end developers to implement new presentation layer, built with:

- Presentation layer in React for 20+ year high profile global trading platform for fortune 500 financial institution.
- User research including c-suite stakeholders. 
- Requirements gathering: balancing user needs and usability heuristics with legacy architecture and technical constraints.
- Provided internal project management of design & dev and facilitated communcation across our and client's team.
- Material.io Design System in Figma with nested styles and components.

On any given day I might:

- Interview and record a stakeholder
- Modify a material-ui component in Figma to create a new component for the project
- clone a repository to my local machine and `yarn install` then `yarn start` in the command line to run the project locally.
- debug a site using chrome or firefox development tools in the browser.  could include inspecting ui issues or adding breakpoints in the network tab to figure out where an api is failing
- create markdown documentation and submit a pull request
- create and manage github issues in a project board 
- draw wireframes for a new page layout
- populate a design with json real data in Sketch

### What I'm Reading

What this content is exactly, is to be determined.  How do I archive (for myself) and share (with others) the content I'm bookmarking, saving to PDF, or Tweeting.  (I use twitter more as a link archive than anything else anyways.)
