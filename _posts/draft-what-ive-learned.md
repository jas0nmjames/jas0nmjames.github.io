# What I've Learned in Two Years of Product

## Thinkrite

## Project Thor

- Relationships are what matter.
- Building a community to build a product that matters.
- Disconnection and misunderstanding is what is most frustrating.  Communication and availability is perhaps the most important piece.
- Learning: debugging react with VS code, github projects, command line in VS code, debugging with Google Chrome, finding my way around the terminal, understanding the development architecture, communicating across my own and client's teams.
- Development best practices: TDD, token api, SDK to handle bad endpoints, etc.
- Product management: the importance of expectation setting, communication and requirements gathering.  Managing UX process and existing technical debt / architecture.  

## Community

## why I enjoy product

- good product design is about process.  I'm all about process.
- there's always something new to learn.  (I tend to get bored.)  Go deeper in one skill.  Go broader in another.  And bring in an entirely new discipline into your work.
- good ux is about empathy. And humility.
- open source as ethos.  Lift as you climb.
- dont aim for success. Make yourself valuable.  And resourcefulness is the greatest value.
