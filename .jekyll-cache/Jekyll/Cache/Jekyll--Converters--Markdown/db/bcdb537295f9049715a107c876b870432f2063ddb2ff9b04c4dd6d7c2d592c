<p>I think my problem is that in collections - notes in this case - the date of the note is based on the date last modified, and not on the name of the markdown file nor the updated date in the front matter.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>The order from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> is respected though.  Thatâ€™s positive. ğŸ‘ï¸</p>

<p>P.S. I just had a eureka moment - I was working on my portfolio around the same time last year!  Several updates to portfolio pieces on the 11th and 12th of February 2020. ğŸ‘€</p>
