<p>Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.</p>

      <td>I shot the picture above with my Galaxy Note 4 smartphone on August 10, 2017.  I was in the middle of a Thursday evening run, looking towards the Washington Monument from the foot of the U.S. Capitol.  Itâ€™s amazing how well this shot came out; other than being in â€˜HDRâ€™ mode, I didnâ€™t edit the image at all.  (Shot: 1/640 sec. f/2.2 4.8mm</td>

<p>I was born in and have lived in the Washington, D.C. region all of my life.  You might think politics would play a larger role in the lives of those around here, but government contracting - however separate from politics it can be - is the real king.  To those who ask, I jokingly and irreverently refer to my place of birth as a â€˜suburban wastelandâ€™.  My childhood trips to New York City gave me the perspective that D.C. and especially its suburbs were often insulated from the economic fates of the rest of the country.  Iâ€™m grateful for the blessings of youth that came from that prosperity; most importantly the experience of daily growing in a world without threat of physical violence.  The cosmopolitan nature of the region also meant that if my friends werenâ€™t white, there was a good chance their parents were first generation immigrants, working in government or technology or research.  But it also meant that there was a sort of rootlessness in how things were held together.  Not by the bonds of community or memory or land, but by status.  And money.  No, not money, thatâ€™s not the word Iâ€™m looking for.  Success.  Yes, thatâ€™s it, â€˜successâ€™.</p>

<p>One of my most poignant memories of high school involved packing up my book bag after the end of - I think it was 10th grade history.  Picture thirty or so odd plywood colored desks, the ones that adults donâ€™t really fit in.  And I had this red rolling backpack because at some point in elementary school my Mom wanted to make sure I wasnâ€™t developing scoliosis or some other unnecessary suffering from the weight of all that Grade-A education textbook workload.  And I thought the rolling backpack was a good idea and nobody made fun of me for it.  I digress - So Iâ€™m packing up my book bag and I notice everyone else literally jumping out of their seats, like in an airplane as soon as the seat belt sign is taken off.  We had a 15 minute break period after the first class so there was nowhere to really rush to.  And I noticed that people - kids - my friends - were in this sort of auto-controlled frenzy of impatience or of â€˜progressâ€™ or of â€˜successâ€™.  And it was peculiar to me then, as it is now.</p>

<p>As I write this first <del>essay</del> blog post, Iâ€™ve turned 30, a little less than a month ago.  Iâ€™m establishing this personal homepage on the web as I begin a new direction in both my professional and personal life.  Not discarding the past, just building on it.  Moving forward.</p>

<p>Like the picture above, the purpose of this site is to show you how I see the world.  Iâ€™m an observer of landscapes.  Landscapes of people, cultures, nature, information, systems.</p>

<p>While completing my MBA I discovered there was a name for the way I like to process the world: â€œsystems thinkingâ€.  Collecting and organizing information (thanks History degree) in process flows rather than simple if -&gt; then statements that attempt to find root causes and holistic solutions.  Iâ€™ll write more about my â€˜whyâ€™, my purpose, later.</p>

<p>I will say that if my â€˜whatâ€™ is systems thinking, my â€˜howâ€™ is empathy in the pursuit of community.  Iâ€™ve always loved when people get along, and Iâ€™ve used authentic leadership towards that end for as long as I can remember.  As Iâ€™ve grown older, Iâ€™ve grown in clarity that itâ€™s more than just â€˜being niceâ€™, but a desire for real peace and understanding between people.  Call it efficient patience.  Something like that.  Maybe thatâ€™ll be a book title someday.</p>

<p>Half-way through my MBA I also discovered User Experience Design or UX Design.  And it appealed to so much of who I am that I had to bring those skills to this craft.  And so Iâ€™m learning and growing and hope youâ€™ll walk with me on this journey.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Peace</p>
