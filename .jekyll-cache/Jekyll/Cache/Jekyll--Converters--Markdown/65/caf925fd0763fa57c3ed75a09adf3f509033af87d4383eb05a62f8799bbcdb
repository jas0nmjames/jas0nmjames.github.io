<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Although officially an “Assistant Vice President of Customer Service Operations”, I like to think of myself as a service designer in a fintech startup.</p>

<p>I live somewhere between business operations, design, and technology, working cross-functionally to build great services for our customers.</p>

<p>I’ve worn lots of hats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chatbot Product Owner, Technical Curator &amp; Designer</li>
  <li>Communications Service Designer &amp; Developer</li>
  <li>Customer service workflow and procedure development</li>
  <li>Integration project manager</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="role">Role</h4>

<p>My role as product owner grew to include technical curator and conversation designer.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-this-role-actually-look-like">What does this role actually look like?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Collaborate in a design sprint with stakeholders and our vendor design &amp; development team to identify and prioritize features</li>
  <li>Create new entities to support a new dialog flow in an existing intent.</li>
  <li>Work with an infrastructure colleague to prioritize and then release a react (web) analytics dashboard.</li>
  <li>Test, debug and document a bug with frontend and backend dev teams in various environments.</li>
  <li>Re-train the machine learning (ML) model after adding nuance to the Watson Assistant dialog to provide a more precise answer for a specific user input.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with design, development &amp; business stakeholders to integrate the chatbot with third party platforms</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h4>

<p>I can’t show you how Saffie works under the hood, but the recordings below highlight some of the key features of this Watson Assistant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Front-end integration with React Native App, including custom UI</li>
  <li>Integration with Salesforce Live Chat, allowing seamless handoff from chatbot to live customer support</li>
  <li>Data integration with wider product infrastructure and security</li>
  <li>Watson Assistant configuration deployed to and paired with Development (DEV), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Production (PRD) environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Saffie can respond to a wide variety of questions and responses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leveraging Watson’s capabilities, misspelled words (within reason) are still recognized.  Type “bsketball” and Saffie will recognize you meant “basketball”.</li>
  <li>Based on the conversation design and curation, there are numerous ways to ask the same question.
    <ul>
      <li>Not only can you ask “Talk to someone” and “Can I talk to someone?” to get the same response</li>
      <li>You can also ask “Chat with someone” or “Call an agent” to get a similar response.  In this case, although chatting and calling are different, the customer may not know what means of communication are available to them.  So we provide them a number of options no matter what type of communication they ask for.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide answers to specific questions about a particular subject, such as “Tell me about your debit card” or more specifically, “Where are ATMs for my debit card?”.</li>
  <li>Ask clarifying questions in response to a general question, such as “What cards do you have?”  In this case, Saffie would respond with a menu of the applicable product(s).</li>
  <li>Integration with the <strong>tone analyzer</strong> detects user sentiment, and can take action if necessary.  In addition to the tone analyzer, user pain statements like “This app sucks” connects the customer with a live agent immediately.</li>
</ul>
