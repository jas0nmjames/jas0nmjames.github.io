<p>Thanks for stopping by! 👋 I’m a product designer who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way;</p>

<p>Putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders, and working with developers line by line in code. I like to tinker.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m a Senior User Experience Designer at Santander Bank, leading conversation design of our virtual assistant “Sandi” for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.</p>

<p>I enjoy spending time with my family, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/22708041">getting outside</a>, and building community.  My interests are pretty wide.  History, Markdown, Triathlons, Design Systems, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLB4Fcxh1iU">Saxsquatch</a>, The Triple Bottom Line, Accessibility, Theology…</p>

<p>I built this site <a href="https://jas0nmjames.github.io/">from scratch with Jekyll</a>, hosted on <a href="https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io">Github</a>.  It’s a playground of sorts where I’m teaching myself the JAMstack among other things.  I told you I like Markdown.  I built <a href="https://jasonmjam.es/">another version of this site</a> with Wordpress.</p>

<p>Finally, if you really want to know more about me, you can see what I’m reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400874-jason-j">Goodreads</a>.</p>
