I"S<p>I previously wrote about building a Design System in Sketch for my own Bloombox project.  Although I canâ€™t take credit for the overall visual design here (a UI designer was on the team), I rebuilt every component within XD and created nested symbols that could accept design changes across multiple components, screens and files.</p>
