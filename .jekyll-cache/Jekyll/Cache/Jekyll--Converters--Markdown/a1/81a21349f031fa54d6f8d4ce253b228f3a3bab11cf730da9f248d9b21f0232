<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>

<p>I built this site from scratch with Jekyll to teach myself the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> and to learn HTML &amp; CSS more deeply.  Itâ€™s my sandbox for trying out new things and hosted for free with <a href="https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io">Github</a> Pages.</p>

<p>Head to <a href="https://jasonmjam.es/">jasonmjam.es</a> for the latest grown-up version of this site, currently built with Wordpress.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a tinkering designer and observer of systems.</p>

<p><strong>I come to UX</strong> with a wide interest in design, business and tech/engineering.  I was a history major in college, but taught computer classes in the summer.  I was a commercial construction manager for five years and earned an MBA at night.  UX helps me stay curious and build things.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a designer because I want to be at the center of people, processes and beauty.  Iâ€™m in tech because of its outsized influence on society.  Iâ€™m in for-profit spaces because C.R.E.A.M. (â€œCash rules everything around me.â€)</p>

<p>Born and raised in Virginia, my wife and I just celebrated <del>seven</del> eight years of marriage and live in South Florida with our two sons.</p>

<p>I prioritize spending time with my family in beloved spaces.</p>

<!--
Most recently I designed, developed and curated a fintech startup's chatbot.  Before that, I was the lead designer & PM for a small agency with work including redesign of a Fortune 500's global trading platform.
-->

<p>Currently, Iâ€™m a Senior User Experience Designer at Santander Bank, leading conversation design of our virtual assistant â€˜Sandiâ€™ for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.</p>

<p>I am made to build belonging and community, even in the middle of - or especially in the middle of - complex technical endeavors.  My <em>sixth man</em> skill is bringing systems thinking and organization to information and processes.</p>

<p>I love music and played in my universityâ€™s drumline.  In my freetime you can find me cooking, training for triathlons or exploring nature by kayak.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thereâ€™s never enough time to do it right, but thereâ€™s always enough time to do it over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jack Bergman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For in the final analysis, our most basic link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our childrenâ€™s future. And we are all mortal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.</p>

  <p>Never lose a holy curiosity. Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will give more than he receives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Albert Einstein</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œHe has told you, O man, what is good;
and what does the LORD require of you
but to do justice, and to love kindness,
and to walk humbly with your God?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Micah 6:8</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All you have is time and grey matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Prater (mentor)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Jesus said to him, â€œâ€˜If you canâ€™! All things are possible for one who believes.â€ Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, â€œI believe; help my unbelief!â€â€</p>

<p>Mark 9:23-24 ESV</p>

  <p>Buy the ticket.  Take the ride.</p>
