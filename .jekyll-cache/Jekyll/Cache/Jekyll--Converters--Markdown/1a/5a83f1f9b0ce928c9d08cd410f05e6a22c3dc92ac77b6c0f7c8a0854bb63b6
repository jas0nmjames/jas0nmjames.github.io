<p>I previously wrote about building a Design System in Sketch for my own <a href="http://jasonmjam.es/portfolio/bloombox-design-sprint/">BloomBox project</a>.</p>

<p>As a member of a four person product team, on my own I built out a design system in Adobe XD for use across the team.</p>

<p>Although I canâ€™t take credit for the overall visual design (a UI designer was on the team), <strong>I personally rebuilt every component within XD and created nested symbols that could accept design changes across multiple components, screens and files.</strong></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of one of the symbols:</p>

<p>Notice in the layer panel on the left, the â€˜conflictsâ€™ icon is nested within the conflicts filter button, which is further nested within a menu.</p>

<p>As the product is not yet fully released and Iâ€™m under NDA, Iâ€™m hesitant to show more, but you can see how this could improve a designerâ€™s workflow: make a change in one place and that change will be reflected everywhere.</p>
