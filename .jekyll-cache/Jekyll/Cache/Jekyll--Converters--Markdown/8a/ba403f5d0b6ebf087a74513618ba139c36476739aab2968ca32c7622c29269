## Quick Notes

- [ ] Name/locate images while you write this article in a way that fixes Jekyll double image storage problem.  
- [ ] Also compare usage of `assets/image.jpg` for example with `![alt text](assets/image.jpg)` with `![alt text](/assets/image.jpg)`.
- Used iA Writer to write this case study *as I was* building the example.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>As of February 2021, I am currently product owner, curator and semi-developer of Saffie, Safrapay‚Äôs chatbot built on the Watson Assistant platform.</p>

<h3 id="my-roles-at-safrapay">My Role(s) at Safrapay</h3>

<p>As a <em>product owner</em>, I work with stakeholders to guide the direction of chatbot features and secure resources for the project.</p>

<p>As <em>curator</em>, I monitor a custom-built dashboard and the Watson Assistant interface to add to or improve the chatbot‚Äôs responses.</p>

<p>I used the term <em>semi-developer</em> above because I am not a front-end developer in the fullest sense of the word, but I know enough about conversational design and the Watson Assistant to be an effective bridge between design, business and development.</p>

<p>I collaborated with, was trained by, and have since replaced two front-end developers from IBM on the project.</p>

<p>Now, I create, modify and structure the intents, entities, and dialog that train Watson Assistant‚Äôs AI.  (Don‚Äôt worry, I explain what these things are below.)</p>

<h3 id="about-safrapay">About Safrapay</h3>

<p><a href="https://safrapay.com/">Safrapay</a> is a fintech startup based here in South Florida with strong connections to Brazil.  We‚Äôre launching this year a payment, banking and credit solution for small and medium sized businesses.</p>

<p>Since we haven‚Äôt launched yet (and more importantly because I‚Äôm currently working for a bank), there‚Äôs not much I can tell you about my work at Safrapay.</p>

<p>Instead, I‚Äôm going to be building a new chatbot from the ground up and hope you‚Äôll join me along the way.  ü§ó</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-documentation">Getting Started: Documentation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The shortest pencil is longer than the longest memory. - ==Unknown==</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Documentation is an essential part of the design &amp; development process.</p>

<p>Before beginning any research, I created a structure for how I wanted to write about this work.  Since I‚Äôm starting this project from the beginning, I have the luxury of putting the right processes in place <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=from%20the%20jump">from jump</a>.</p>

<p>As a designer, documenting your process along the way provides a living memory to help guide your work.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get caught down the rabbit hole of a problem that in the larger context is not important.  Referring back to the foundational goals of the project regularly might help keep you on track.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, documentation serves as a record to explain to stakeholders (and your future self) why certain decisions were made.</p>

<p>As a developer, in addition to writing clean and well structured code, documenting your code with inline comments similarly helps explain and remember.  You can also provide additional guidance in external documents like a README.</p>

<p>I wrote about this project in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a>.  For more on why, you can read about my love of Markdown ==here==. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insert link</code></p>

<p><a href="https://www.coralsprings.org/home">The City of Coral Springs website</a></p>

<h4 id="information-architecture-reviewing-the-existing-site-map">Information Architecture: Reviewing the Existing Site Map</h4>

<p>The site‚Äôs existing <a href="https://www.coralsprings.org/how-do-i/site-map/-smview-cate">site map</a> is a great place to start to get a handle on the site‚Äôs (and the city‚Äôs) content and existing architecture.</p>

<p><a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> is a great tool for exploring Information Architecture.  I was able to copy and paste the site map into MindNode to help understand how the content is structured.</p>

<p>I was going to insert the map inline here, but it was too long!  <a href="/assets/portfolio/watson-assistant-chatbot/coral-springs-ia-existing.png">You can view or download it here.</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve also exported the entire mind map as a <a href="/assets/portfolio/watson-assistant-chatbot/coral-springs-ia-existing.md">markdown file available here</a>.  You might find it helpful if you cannot view or access any of the images of the map inline below.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at just the top level:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/watson-assistant-chatbot/coral-springs-ia-existing_top-level.png" alt="A mind map with a parent of &quot;coralsprings.org&quot; and the following children: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Living&quot;, &quot;Visiting&quot;, &quot;Doing Business&quot;, &quot;Government&quot;, and &quot;How Do I?&quot;" /></p>

<p>Because coralsprings.org has so much information, for the purposes of this project, let‚Äôs focus on the ‚ÄúHow Do I?‚Äù section of the site, since that will likely include the most common questions asked:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/watson-assistant-chatbot/coral-springs-ia-existing_how-do-i.png" alt="A mind map of the &quot;How Do I?&quot; section of the site map" /></p>

<p>After review, I decide that this is a pretty good starting point for building the chatbot.  Before digging in, let‚Äôs step back to discuss conversational design and a few foundational principles for building a chatbot with the Watson Assistant.</p>

<p>There are three types of skills in the Watson Assistant:</p>

  <li>Actions</li>
  <li>Dialog</li>
  <li>Search</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only be using the full-feature dialog skill for this project.  As this project evolves, we might augment our dialog skill with an actions skill (<em>still in Beta at the time of this writing</em>) for additional functionality, but I won‚Äôt go into detail about that now.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add">learn more about the different skills here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-assistant">Creating the Assistant</h3>

<h3 id="creating-the-skills">Creating the Skill(s)</h3>

<h3 id="the-dialog-skill">The Dialog Skill</h3>

<p>The dialog skill is comprised of two main building blocks - intents and entities - which are constructed into dialog, which is the conversation logic the Watson Assistant AI follows to figure out how to best answer a user input (be that a question or a response).</p>

<p>As defined by IBM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An intent is a collection of user statements that have the same meaning. By creating intents, you train your assistant to understand the variety of ways users express a goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entities are like nouns or keywords. By building out your business terms in entities your assistant can provide targeted responses to queries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>https://us-east.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs?topic=assistant-entities</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dialog uses the intents that are identified in the user‚Äôs input, plus context from the application, to interact with the user and ultimately provide a useful response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build</p>

<h3 id="an-example-who-do-i-call">An Example: Who Do I Call?</h3>

<p>My aim in this case study is not to give you an in-depth tutorial on <em>how</em> to build a chatbot with the Watson Assistant.  My aim is to give you a high level view of how the pieces fit together, augmented with a few peeks ‚Äòunder the hood‚Äô, if you will.</p>

<p>In our first ‚Äòpeak‚Äô, let‚Äôs look at a relatively simple dialog: ‚ÄúWho do I call?‚Äù</p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-call-creating-the-intent">Who Do I Call?: Creating the Intent</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/watson-assistant-chatbot/screenshot_intents_created_who-do-i-call.png" alt="A screenshot of the intent, &quot;Who Do I Call?&quot;" /></p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-call-creating-the-dialog">Who Do I Call?: Creating the Dialog</h4>

<p>In the Watson Assistant, dialog is comprised of nodes.</p>

<p>Per the IBM <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-gs-dialog#gs-dialog-build-dialog">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dialog defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree. It matches intents (what users say) to responses (what your virtual assistant says back). Each node of the tree has a condition that triggers it, based on user input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each node is built with the following logic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Node name (optional)</li>
  <li><strong>If</strong> the <strong>assistant recognizes</strong> a filter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#intent</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@entity</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$context_variable</code> or a common condition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">welcome</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anything_else</code>, then the</li>
  <li><strong>Assistant responds</strong> with one or more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">option</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pause</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect to human agent</code>,</li>
  <li><strong>Then</strong> the <strong>assistant should</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait for reply</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skip user input</code> (and evaluate child nodes) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jump to</code> another node.</li>
</ol>
