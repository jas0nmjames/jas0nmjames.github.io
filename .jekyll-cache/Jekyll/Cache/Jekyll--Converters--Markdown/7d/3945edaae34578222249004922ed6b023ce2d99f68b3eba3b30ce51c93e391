I"S<p>This is a test.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/jas0nmjames/status/1266056941614370816">was inspired</a> by <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/">Nadia</a> to add a ‘Notes’ section to this site.</p>

<p>As described in the readme to this site, one of the goals of moving all of my content into Markdown was to unify how I write, which is really unifying how I take notes.</p>

<p>Since switching to <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for my daily notepad, I’ve been writing more.  ‘Notes’ are what I write as I live day to day and form the basis of essays.</p>
