<p>Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m a product designer and product manager who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way;</p>

<p>Putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders and working with developers line by line in code.</p>

<p>I design and manage projects with <a href="http://cross.team">cross.team</a> in South Florida, USA.</p>

<p>I enjoy spending time with my family, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/22708041">getting outside</a>, and building community.  My interests are pretty wide.  History, Markdown, Triathlons, Design Systems, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLB4Fcxh1iU">Saxsquatch</a>, The Tripple Bottom Line, Accessibility, Theologyâ€¦</p>

<p>I built this site <a href="https://jas0nmjames.github.io/">from scratch with Jekyll</a>, hosted on <a href="https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io">Github</a>.  Itâ€™s a playground of sorts where Iâ€™m teaching myself the JAMstack among other things.  I told you I like Markdown.  I built <a href="https://jasonmjam.es/">another version of this site</a> with Wordpress.</p>

<p>Finally, if you really want to know more about me, you can see what Iâ€™m reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400874-jason-j">Goodreads</a>.</p>
