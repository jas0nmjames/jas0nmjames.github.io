I"‚<p>Our team took over development of a web accessibility application after a previous developer didnâ€™t finish the project.  With little documentation, we needed to fix bugs in the code, while improving the overall UX of the product.  In addition, the team lead performed a usability heuristics audit of the companyâ€™s overall website, including the applicationâ€™s landing page.</p>
