<p>Believe it or not, sometimes we need to send styled e-mails without a fancy service.</p>

<p>E-mail development is actually <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/">pretty tricky</a>.</p>

<p>For example, when developing e-mails for Safrapay, I had to revert to using an html <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;table&gt;</code> layout instead of a modern layout like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">css-grid</a>.</p>

<p>Between how the html was handled in the Salesforce tool we were using at the time (we didn‚Äôt have access to their more modern marketing suite) and how different e-mail clients (Outlook only reads inline styling.  No stylesheets or even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code>s!) display html, I had to creatively go backwards.</p>
