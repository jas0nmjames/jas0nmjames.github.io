I"s<p>Currently, I’m a (Contract) Senior User Experience Designer at <a href="https://www.santanderbank.com/">Santander Bank</a>, leading conversation design of our virtual assistant “Sandi” for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.</p>

<p>Day to day, this looks like solely supporting three development teams with UX research, UX/UI design, and conversation design for web, iOS and Android.</p>

<p>I’m part of a small, but growing design team supporting the larger digital transformation effort for the bank’s 2 million + customers in the US.  We collaborate and support each other on a weekly basis and are part of a larger global design consortium for the global bank.</p>

<p>The screenshots below are taken from the production iOS application.</p>

<p>A key win for the user experience in this project was <em>not</em> placing an entry point for Sandi, our Virtual Assistant, on the login screen, which was already filled with a call-to-action and several secondary buttons.</p>

<p>With the support of the Head of UX and using supporting secondary market research and my analysis of user utterances in Sandi (inputted user text), I worked with developers, the product owner, and the product manager, to not add an unneeded entry point.</p>

<p>Sometimes the biggest UX outcomes are about what <em>doesn’t</em> show up in the UI.</p>

<h3 id="creating-design-system-ui-components-for-sandi">Creating Design System UI Components for Sandi</h3>

<p>With Figma’s Auto Layout, Components and Variants, I created UI components for our design system that are adaptable for a variety of design needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Components that automatically resize horizontally to accommodate mocked text</li>
  <li>Components that automatically resize vertically to accommodate longer strings of mocked text</li>
  <li>Placing components within variants that have multiple properties to accommodate theming.  For example, the same component might be vertically growing and light themed, with a variant that is horizontally growing and dark themed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to explore below how these components are put together.</p>
