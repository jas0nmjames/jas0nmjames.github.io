<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I previously created my portfolio site with Wordpress.  That site is still accessible at <a href="jasonmjam.wordpress.com">jasonmjam.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of benefits in creating a site with a powerful CMS like Wordpress, but I wanted to build a new site from scratch for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown</a> as widely as possible.  This includes when taking personal notes, writing documentation for work, and in this case, creating site content.  For many years Iâ€™ve had notes in all sorts of formats across different devices.  Itâ€™s been inefficient and a pain to unify.  Iâ€™d like to follow <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb</a> principles.  With markdown, I own my content and formatting is (largely) universal.</li>
  <li>Create clean markdown copies of my past writing for archival purposes.</li>
  <li>Refresh my Sketch (and larger UI) chops.  I have been working a lot in Figma at work.  In another side project concurrent to this one, Iâ€™m learning Framer X.</li>
  <li>Learn CSS Grids.  See inspiration from <a href="https://ahmadnassri.com/">Ahmad Nassri</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/meowlivia_/status/1116784686640979968">Olivia Ng</a></li>
  <li>Experiment with static site generators.</li>
  <li>Learn the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> a bit better after seeing my dev colleagues working in React and Gatsby.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="translating-markdown">Translating Markdown</h2>

<p>My intial task was to translate the existing pages I had written on my Wordpress site or on Medium into Markdown.  This provided a chance to revisit my case studies and improve formatting when necessary.</p>

<p>There are some markdown converters available, but I wanted to ensure my posts were clean.  It took quite a bit of time.  <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> helped a bit by copying and pasting assets into a separate directory for each post.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>I first created a rough layout in markdown of the content I wanted to build the site with.  (See <a href="working-folder/content-home.md">content-home.md</a>)</p>

<p>After viewing many contemporary designs, considering I wanted my site to be <strong>accessible</strong>, and considering the possibilities of markdown and Jekyll, I decided on a simple, text-focused mostly black-and-white design with ample white space.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iâ€™ll revist this post in the future and comment more on the design decisions in more detail.</p>

<p>I than began to lay out the site in Sketch across multiple device sizes for good responsive design:</p>

<p><img src="2020-02-11-jekyllrb/sketch.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h3 id="a-short-note-on-typography">A short note on Typography</h3>

<p>I had previously developed personal branding which formed a starting point for some of the design.</p>

<p>However, after exploring several fonts I settled on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One">Patua One</a>, instead of the previously used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prata">Prata</a>, to communicate the feeling I am trying to convey in this minimalist design.  They both pair nicely with Roboto, which I am using as body text throughout.</p>

<p>In the future I will write about this in greater detail.</p>

<h2 id="translating-the-design-to-html--css">Translating the Design to HTML &amp; CSS</h2>

<p>Before building the site with Jekyll and Liquid templating, I created local html &amp; css to experiment with the design, especially as related to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">CSS Grids</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">Responsiveness</a>.</p>

<h3 id="css-grids">CSS Grids</h3>

<p>It was my first time working in detail with CSS Grids and I wanted to build everything from scratch so I could really understand their implementation.</p>

<p>Here, Iâ€™m using Firefoxâ€™s inspector to view the developed grids:</p>

<p><img src="2020-02-11-jekyllrb/inspecting-css-grids.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The grid system helps organize the content and even reorganize the content depending on screen type, size and orientation.</p>

<h3 id="tweaking-html--css">Tweaking HTML &amp; CSS</h3>

<p>You can find the code before I translated everything over to Jekyll in the working folder:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="working-folder/index.html">Original HTML</a></li>
  <li><a href="working-folder/style.css">Original CSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also created templates for different page types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="working-folder/template-article-list.html">Portfolio Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="working-folder/template-article-writing.html">Post Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="working-folder/template-article-list.html">List Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="working-folder/template-page.html">General Page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>View the <a href="https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io/commits/master">commit history</a> to see all the tweaks made over the course of exploring and understanding the design.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<h3 id="learning-jekyll">Learning Jekyll</h3>

<p>I spent some type in the Jekyll tutorial to learn the basics of Ruby and Liquid along with Jekyllâ€™s typical configuration.</p>

<p>With Jekyll installed locally, I could build and serve my new site with a few key commands in the termial:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll build</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Jekyll is easy to deploy with Github, so I created a new repository, configured it for integration with Jekyll, and was on my way.</p>

<h3 id="building-out-the-site">Building Out the Site</h3>

<p>I faced a few hurdles in getting my site working properly, mainly around getting Jekyll â€˜configurationsâ€™ working and targeting different parts of the site with CSS to ensure a clean, responsive design.  Styles evolved as needed and will continue to.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io/commits/master">commit history</a> to see how development progressed over time.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about why Iâ€™m using html classes and ids the way I am, or how Iâ€™m using liquid templating, or other choices I made, please let me know!</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m so glad I built this site from scratch.  Iâ€™ve increased my understanding of HTML &amp; CSS several fold and have more context in which to engage developers in general.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve run into several blockers which have meant itâ€™s taken much longer for me to complete this site, but Iâ€™m glad for it.</p>

<p>As I continue to refine and build out the site, Iâ€™ll update this post accordingly.</p>
