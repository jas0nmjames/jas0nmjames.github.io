## Writing

I took a Latin American history course with Professor Herbert Braun at the University of Virginia.  I was struggling with depression and purpose and frustration.  As an aide, one day he mentioned to me most of us can only hope to improve one's family.  The tide of history, the wickedness of men is too great.  

The technologists seem to be the ones that shape history, truly.  The guy who invented the shipping container.  The guy who created dynamite (Nobel).  And Aaron Swartz.  

The change book talks about "how to change when change is hard" we can alter the frameworks in which we need to be disciplined in order to ease the decision making process.  Want to eat less?  Don't just rely on will-power.  Start with a smaller plate, which will allow selecting less food to be easier.  Even if it's an invisible change.

Aaron Swartz appeared to suffer from depression.  And colitus.  And he accomplished so much.  Right time, right place.  But also right person.

I've noticed that many of the 'great men' of history were not good family men.  Mandela.  King.  

I've thought the purpose of life was to learn what you can't learn in heaven.  And to build the kingdom.  To make 'gentle the life of this world" or to help, in our little task, "make all things new".  But the technologists seem to hold most of the cards.

What then does it mean to leave a good life (as oppossed to a merely successful one) and a useful life (see the purpose of life is the be useful)?

What problems should we be solving (even though we often make them worse)?  

What questions should we be asking?  

What is worth our time?
