This is a test.

I [was inspired](https://twitter.com/jas0nmjames/status/1266056941614370816) by [Nadia](https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/) to add a 'Notes' section to this site.

As described in the readme to this site, one of the goals of moving all of my content into Markdown was to unify how I write, which is really unifying how I take notes.

Since switching to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for my daily notepad, I've been writing more.  'Notes' are what I write as I live day to day and form the basis of essays.
