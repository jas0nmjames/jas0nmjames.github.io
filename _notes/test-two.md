## Comment on 2021-02-11

I think my problem is that in collections - notes in this case - the date of the note is based on the date last modified, and not on the name of the markdown file nor the updated date in the front matter.

Why is this?

The order from `_config.yml` is respected though.  That's positive. 👍️

P.S. I just had a eureka moment - I was working on my portfolio around the same time last year!  Several updates to portfolio pieces on the 11th and 12th of February 2020. 👀
