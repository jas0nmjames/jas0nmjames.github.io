I previously wrote about building a Design System in Sketch for my own [BloomBox project](http://jasonmjam.es/portfolio/bloombox-design-sprint/).

Much of my work in 2018 has been under NDA and I won't be able to walk you through the design process. However, I wanted to share with you an example of the sort of advanced prototyping I've had the [opportunity to put together:](http://jasonmjam.es/portfolio/advanced-prototyping/)
