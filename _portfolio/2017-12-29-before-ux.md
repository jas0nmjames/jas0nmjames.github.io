I was on the construction team (and when noted also the marketing team) as Assistant Project Manager or Project Manager for the projects below. I worked closely with the design team (architects and engineers), clients, and trade subcontractors to make these projects happen on-time, within budget, and built to the highest standards. The awards prove it.*

Many thanks to my colleagues at [E.E. Reed](https://www.eereedmidatlantic.com/) for making me part of the family. What we accomplished is plain to see.
