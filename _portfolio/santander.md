Currently, I’m a (Contract) Senior User Experience Designer at [Santander Bank](https://www.santanderbank.com/), leading conversation design of our virtual assistant “Sandi” for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.

Day to day, this looks like solely supporting three development teams with UX research, UX/UI design, and conversation design for web, iOS and Android.

I'm part of a small, but growing design team supporting the larger digital transformation effort for the bank's 2 million + customers in the US.  We collaborate and support each other on a weekly basis and are part of a larger global design consortium for the global bank.

## Projects

- Sandi, the Virtual Assistant: research, conversation design maintenance, improvements and additions
- Sandi, the Virtual Assistant: Entry point UI design for mobile
- Report Your Card Lost or Stolen: UX/UI design for web
- Dispute Tracking: research and UX/UI design for web and mobile

I'll provide more details as each project is released to production.
