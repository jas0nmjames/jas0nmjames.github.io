Currently, I’m a (Contract) Senior User Experience Designer at [Santander Bank](https://www.santanderbank.com/), leading conversation design of our virtual assistant “Sandi” for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.

Day to day, this looks like solely supporting three development teams with UX research, UX/UI design, and conversation design for web, iOS and Android.

I'm part of a small, but growing design team supporting the larger digital transformation effort for the bank's 2 million + customers in the US.  We collaborate and support each other on a weekly basis and are part of a larger global design consortium for the global bank.

### Virtual Assistant Entry Point UI Design for Mobile

The screenshots below are taken from the production iOS application.

A key win for the user experience in this project was *not* placing an entry point for Sandi, our Virtual Assistant, on the login screen, which was already filled with a call-to-action and several secondary buttons.

With the support of the Head of UX and using supporting secondary market research and my analysis of user utterances in Sandi (inputted user text), I worked with developers, the product owner, and the product manager, to not add an unneeded entry point.

Sometimes the biggest UX outcomes are about what *doesn't* show up in the UI.

### Creating Design System UI Components for Sandi

With Figma's Auto Layout, Components and Variants, I created UI components for our design system that are adaptable for a variety of design needs:

- Components that automatically resize horizontally to accommodate mocked text
- Components that automatically resize vertically to accommodate longer strings of mocked text
- Placing components within variants that have multiple properties to accommodate theming.  For example, the same component might be vertically growing and light themed, with a variant that is horizontally growing and dark themed.

Feel free to explore below how these components are put together.

*I'm hosting the components below in a personal Figma instance for security:*
