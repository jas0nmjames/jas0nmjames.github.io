## About This Site

I built this site from scratch with Jekyll to teach myself the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and to learn HTML & CSS more deeply.  It's my sandbox for trying out new things and hosted for free with [Github](https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io) Pages.

Head to [jasonmjam.es](https://jasonmjam.es/) for the latest grown-up version of this site, currently built with Wordpress.

## About Me

I'm a tinkering designer and observer of systems.

I'm a designer because I want to be at the center of people, processes and beauty.  I'm in tech because of its outsized influence on society.  I'm in for-profit spaces because C.R.E.A.M. ("Cash rules everything around me.")

I prioritize spending time with my family in beloved spaces.

Currently, I’m a Senior User Experience Designer at Santander Bank, leading conversation design of our virtual assistant 'Sandi' for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.

## Favorite Quotes

Robert F. Kennedy

> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.

> Never lose a holy curiosity. Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will give more than he receives.

Albert Einstein
