**#design**, **#systemsthinking** and **#business** for the **#commongood**.

***

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹  I'm a product designer and product manager who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way;

Putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders and working with developers line by line in code.

I design and manage projects with [cross.team](http://cross.team) in South Florida, USA.

I enjoy spending time with my family, [getting outside](https://www.strava.com/athletes/22708041), and building community.  My interests are pretty wide.  History, Markdown, Triathlons, Design Systems, [Saxsquatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLB4Fcxh1iU), The Tripple Bottom Line, Accessibility, Theology...

I built this site [from scratch with Jekyll](https://jas0nmjames.github.io/), hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io).  It's a playground of sorts where I'm teaching myself the JAMstack among other things.  I told you I like Markdown.  I built [another version of this site](https://jasonmjam.es/) with Wordpress.

Finally, if you really want to know more about me, you can see what I'm reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400874-jason-j).
