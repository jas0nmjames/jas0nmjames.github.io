**#design**, **#systemsthinking** and **#business** for the **#commongood**.

***

Thanks for stopping by! üëã I‚Äôm a product designer who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way;

Putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders, and working with developers line by line in code. I like to tinker.

Currently, I‚Äôm a Senior User Experience Designer at Santander Bank, leading conversation design of our virtual assistant ‚ÄúSandi‚Äù for the US team and UX design for the self-service value stream on web and mobile.

I enjoy spending time with my family, [getting outside](https://www.strava.com/athletes/22708041), and building community.  My interests are pretty wide.  History, Markdown, Triathlons, Design Systems, Synthwave, The Triple Bottom Line, Accessibility, Theology...

I built this site [from scratch with Jekyll](https://jas0nmjames.github.io/), hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jas0nmjames/jas0nmjames.github.io).  It's a playground of sorts where I'm teaching myself the JAMstack among other things.  I told you I like Markdown.  I built [another version of this site](https://jasonmjam.es/) with Wordpress.

Finally, if you really want to know more about me, you can see what I'm reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400874-jason-j).
