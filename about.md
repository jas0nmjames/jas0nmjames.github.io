#design, #systems-thinking and #business for the #common good.

I'm a product design generalist who loves solving problems at the root and building community along the way; putting users at the center, collaborating with stakeholders and working with developers line by line in code.

I design and manage projects with [cross.team](http://cross.team) in South Florida, USA.
